##### Overview

 - The files in theÂ [TASK](./TASK1)Â directory are all playbooks, codes and scripts to bootstrap an Apache server and load balancerÂ on AWS. ðŸš€
 - I wrote a short description on each terraform file to declare what is the purpose of each of them.


##### CI/CD clarifications:

- I have set CI/CD pipeline workflowsÂ [Github Action](./.github/workflows)Â for provisioning the infrastructure, CI pipeline (linting and testing), and also for destroying.

- You can easily clone the repository and use it in your desired configurations. You just need to define AWS access keys on repository secrets.

- The deployment [workflow](./.github/workflows/provision.yml) run by pushing the code into or merging withÂ branch `main` and perform the following actions:
    * provision infrastructures described on terraform configuration files.
    * a delayed job is triggered to wait for few minutes till EC2 instances being ready.
    * Finally, the ansible-playbook will be run to deploy a simple Apache web server on the target instance.

- The CI [workflow](./.github/workflows/check.yml) (which is run on branch `dev`) contains a linting process to check the typo and code style on Ansible roles and also testing the whole playbook on different Linux distributions with molecule.

- I have set a [workflow](./.github/workflows/destroy.yml)Â in order to destroy the created resources which would be run mannually.

##### Checking The Apache Service periodically

 1- There is a [workflow](./.github/workflows/check.yml) to check the Apache service is up and running, every 15 minutes. It uses a simple ansible ad-hoc command to SSH to the server and ensure httpd service is running as expected.

 2- Direcotry [monitor](./TASK1/monitor/) contains a simple application written in Go to check the server availability and notify based on its [configurations](./TASK1/monitor/configs/default.json). You Just need to update the IP address and Slack tokens in config file and simply build the Dockerfile by running `docker-compose build` and `docker-compose up`
